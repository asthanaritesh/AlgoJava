Abstract Factory pattern is similar to Factory pattern and it’s factory of factories.
In factory design pattern, we have a single Factory class that returns the different sub-classes based on the input provided 
and factory class uses if-else or switch statement to achieve this.

In Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class and 
then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class.
